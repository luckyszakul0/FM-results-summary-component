## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript for injecting JSON
- Variable font file

### What I learned

The most influencial thing I learned were basic operations with JSON files and injecting them into HTML.  
The other thing was in this project I first learned about variable fonts and how to declare them in CSS.

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'HankenGrotesk';
  src: url(assets/fonts/HankenGrotesk-VariableFont_wght.ttf) format('truetype');
  font-weight: 500 800;
}
```
```js
async function loadJSONData(){
  const response = await fetch('./data.json');
  const names = await response.json();

  let i = 0;
  for(const component of componentsArray){
      component.children[0].children[1].innerHTML = names[i].category;
      component.children[1].children[0].innerHTML = names[i].score;
      component.children[0].children[0].setAttribute("src", names[i].icon);
      i++;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

In future project I plan to use a CSS preprocessor, probably Sass, because the code bloat is getting tiring.
Also, as I'm actively learning jQuery, I plan to use it more often.
Another subject that requires my attention are JS Promises.
